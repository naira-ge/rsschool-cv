### Summary

I was passionate about renewable energy because it was cool to see math and technology transforming a whole industry. But after years of working in the energy field, my passion is now in **Front-end development**.
I believe my background in the energy system design field would provide value and adding a unique perspective. It is really *awesome* that you could tell a computer exactly how to do something and figure out how to do it better by using mind and code.

I'm a fast and enthusiastic learner, learning path opportunities multiply as they are seized. I enjoy learning JavaScript and more deeply understand **JavaScript** under the hood and use it for creating quality products.  At the same time, I wanted to learn a *ton* in software development and improve my development skill.
